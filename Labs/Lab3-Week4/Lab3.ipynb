However, for larger datasets this will become impossible to do. To still get an idea about what our data looks like, we can instead use what is called the \"summary statistics\", which amongst others generally includes measures of central tendency like mean and median. Those characteristics will give us an idea about our data without going through a long list of individual data points.  \nFor you to practice this firstly load the larvae dataset,**make sure that the csv file is located in the same folder as the .jypnb file you opened**.\n\n\nTo start, you firstly need to read in the larvae dataset. Like last week, the `head()` command will print the first 6 rows of observations of the larvae dataset. "

Quantiles are important constructs in statistics, which we will use later on during this semester when we dive into statistical testing. But first, let's familiarize with the meaning of a **p-quantile**. If you already feel confident enough, try to write down a formal definition of a p-quantile or explain it to your neighbour and answer the questions in your assessment. Otherwise, keep on reading. \n\nBasically the idea of a p-quantile is to split the **ascending list of obersvations**, such that p * 100% of the observations lie to the left of the quantile and (1-p)* 100% of the observations lie to the right of the quantile. We then call the value that splits the dataset in such a way a \"p-quantile\". For example, going back to your results above, 25% of the observations from the 'Insecticide' variable are smaller or equal to 1.525 and 75% of the observations from that dataset are bigger or equal to 1.525.\n\nThe `summary()` command yields the 0.25, the 0.5 and the 0.75 quantiles. Together, those qunatiles split the entire list of observations into 4 quarters, which is why they are also called **quartiles**. However, it is of course possible to also obtain other quantiles. R provides an easy command for this."
