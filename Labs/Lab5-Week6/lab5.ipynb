The residual standard error represents the average (vertical) distance between the observed values and the regression line measured in units of the dependent variable. You will also find the coefficient of determination $R^2$, which indicates how well the model approximates observations. You can ignore all other output for now.\n\n\nFrom the above results, answer the following questions: \n\n* What is the estimated regression line? **Write it out.** \n* From the output, what are $\\beta_0$, $\\beta_1$ and $R^2$?\n* For your data, does it appear that 'Distance' depends on 'Velocity'?
