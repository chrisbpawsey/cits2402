This is equivalent to mean-centering and scaling the data with the inverse of its standard deviation. The resulting data can then be expressed as a deviation from the mean in multiples of the standard deviation. If for instance any given datapoint is equal to 3.5 after standardisation, we interpret this datapoint to be 3.5 standard deviations above the mean of the corresponding dataset. \n\nThe standardisation helps to make data from different populations comparable.\n\nThe following dataset contains imaginary information on mathematics and physics students.
