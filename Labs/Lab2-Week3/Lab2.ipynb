In data science, the purpose of writing a program is to instruct a computer to carry out the steps of analysis. Computers cannot study the world on their own. People must describe precisely what steps the computer should take to collect and analyse data, and those steps are expressed through programs.\n\n## Expressions\nProgramming languages are much simpler than human languages. Nonetheless, there are some rules of grammar to learn in any language. We will use the R programming language. Learning the grammar rules is essential, and the same rules used in the most basic programs are also central to more sophisticated programs.\n\nPrograms are made up of expressions, which describe to the computer how to combine pieces of data. For example, a multiplication expression consists of a * symbol between two numerical expressions. Expressions, such as 3 * 4, are evaluated by the computer. The value (the result of evaluation) of the last expression in each cell is displayed below the cell."
